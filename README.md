Tic-Tac-Toe Game - Python Project
Welcome to the Tic-Tac-Toe Game project! This is a simple, fun implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built using Python and the tkinter module for the graphical interface. It's a two-player game where you can enjoy the timeless Xs and Os in a friendly, user-friendly environment.

Features
Graphical Interface: Built with tkinter, the game features an interactive 3x3 grid for easy play.
Two Players: Players take turns marking X or O in the grid.
Win Detection: The game automatically checks for a win or a tie after each move.
Game Reset: The board resets after each game, allowing for continuous play.
Technologies Used
Python: The core programming language used for logic.
Tkinter: A Python library for creating graphical user interfaces (GUIs).
How to Play
Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
Run the game by executing the Python file. Make sure tkinter is installed (it usually comes pre-installed with Python).
Click on the squares to place your mark (X or O).
The game will notify you when someone wins or if itâ€™s a tie. Afterward, the board will reset automatically for a new round.
How to Run
Make sure you have Python installed on your system.

Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the folder containing the game.

Run the following command:

bash
Copy code
python tictactoe.py
Future Improvements
Add a single-player mode with AI for solo play.
Implement a scoring system to track player wins.
Customize the design with new colors or styles.
